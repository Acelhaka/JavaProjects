PROJECT1
Amarilda Celhaka 
This project was a interesting one since it is the first project. 
I had some minor issues first trying to work on java language and validating the user input. 
For the intelligent strategy I tried first to see if there was any specific pattern of the random numbers after a certain range.
I printed around 30 random numbers, but I did not notice any pattern, so that did not help. 
I looked at the statistics for a while and statistics show that the player after loses tend to change his last pick 
(also after reading on tricks how to win the 
paper-scissor-rock game) 
EG. if user = "Bear" and computer = "Hunter" , computer wins. Since computer wins the user
will pick something different than BEAR, so either Hunter or Ninja, and in this case if computer pick Ninja is a safe choice 
to either win or tie.
