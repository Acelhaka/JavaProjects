Project #3

On this project I struggled a lot compared to the previous projects.
At first I thought that the relation between classes was inheritance. 
A wumpus Word "is" made of squares. I was halfway done with my project
when I realized that A Wumpus World "has" square, composite relation. 
I am glad I had started early so I could modify my code from inheritance 
to composition.  
After that I tried to reuse the same code/logic of my methods, and I created 
a two dimensional array of object squares. I think the hardest part of this
project was understanding what we need to do, and setting everything on the gameboard.
I did not have a very clear idea of the organization of classes first and started
coding,which did not end up being a very good idea. 
After that, moving the human and doing validations for out of bound was easier.
My project, may not have the exact content of classes as required from the
assignment. Randmoly filling the squares with P/W is done through 
Wumpus class. I was thinking of changing it, that is why I came to the office 
to talk about the project, however I was not sure I was going to finish everything
on time, including the 2 UML diagrams and README file. 
Overall challenging but interesting project and fun game to play.
