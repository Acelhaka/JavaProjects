Project #6
Due: 12/5/2018


The way I set up my UI for the game, is by creating a boarder pane. 
I split it up in three custom panes, one positioned on top, 
holding a horizontal Box, one on the right, holding a vertical
box, which in itself contains the labels for Sunk,Misses and Hits
and also a picture of a ship. 
Centered in the middle is a gridpane, that contains 100 buttons,
stored in a 10X10 matrix. 
I setOnaction button hit for practise, so it will Increment after
each hit of the button. 
Project overall was easy, however time consuming since it was the first
time I was working with the UI components.
